    "I lived in the city of Austin, Texas for 4 years. I personally saw how the city was increasing in different types of businesses. However, Austin is a small city which can make it difficult to place new businesses in already crowded locations like downtown. The crowdedness in a single area is not the only concern, but that single area can also have similar types of businesses. \n",

    "In this report I will cluster similar venues around the different zip codes in Austin. New business owners should then be able to use this report to stratigically place their new business in Austin. With the help of <b>Foursquare</b>, we should be able to: see the amount of businesses in an area, the types of businesses, and the most common venues of an area.\n",
